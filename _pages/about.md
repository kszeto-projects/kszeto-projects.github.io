I am currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at UC San Diego with a focus in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls, and will be graduating in March 2025. I graduated in 2021 from the University of the Pacific with a B.S. in Bioengineering and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. 

I am interested in robotic control & manipulation, perception, and motion planning to help create reliable, safe, and impactful robots that improve our quality of life. I am currently a part of a research lab at UCSD that focuses on multi-agent semantic mapping for outdoor environments, which has allowed me to work closely with the ROS framework using Python and C++. I have worked on gathering test data with the Clearpath Jackal ground wheeled robots, testing the stack in Gazebo sim, and transitioning the current stack on the ROS1 framework to ROS2. 

I have recently worked as a full-time Electrical Engineer and then Product Design Engineer at Left Coast Engineering for over two years in rapid product development. I managed multiple types of projects ranging from an IoT liquid measurement sensor to testing and reworking a custom laser diffraction sensor for analyzing sediment in solution. I designed, fabricated, and tested multiple printed circuit boards, worked on microcontroller embedded programming, and designed several mechanical testing fixtures through the wide variety of projects that I was able to work on. This summer, I interned at Devonics Automation, Inc. as an Automation Engineering Intern where I helped program automated tests for their battery longevity tests using a suite of 6-DOF robot manipulators. I also worked on a newly acquired AMR to understand its functionality and presented what I learned to the team. Previously, I also interned at Procept BioRobotics and Abbott Laboratories where I used my skills and knowledge from my bioengineering and electrical engineering background to work on testing a novel aquablation technology, design test protocols for the LVAD heart implant, and create a heatmap of the ECMO oxygenation system's packaging wear and tear.
