#**About Me**
My name is Kevin Szeto and I am an aspiring Robotics Software Engineer. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering with a focus in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls from UC San Diego. I am interested in many areas of robotics including motion planning, perception, and controls for robot manipulators. I am currently a part of a research team focused on multi-agent semantic mapping for outdoor environments, which has allowed me to work closely with the ROS framework using Python and C++.
